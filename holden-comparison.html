          Project overview

        <p>
            WThe Model Comparison tool was a project I worked on while at Isobar. Designed to facilitate model comparison within the site and allow users to easily discover and find their perfect fit within the product range.We wanted the experience to be easy to get into and understand how to read the details, as well as display differences clearly. We also carefully considered how this would sit on the site and lead into areas such as Build and Price.

      An easy process to enter the tool and not be overwhelmed.
    </h1>
    <p>
      We made the decison to always load up 3 vehicles once a user enters the tool, with the vehicles depending where on the site you entered from. This approach would give them a starting point and from there the focus was making it easy to change which vehicles you were comparing, and make sure they are relevant.Depending on your entry point, a different set of vehicles would be displayed. Users coming from a carline page would see a range of models from within there, from the base to the top spec model, whereas if you clicked through from a segment such as SUV's we would want to compare 3 similar family cars.</p>

      Employing smart design patterns reducing complexity of data.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Understanding the differences when comparing a base level model to the top spec within a carline can be confusing when not presentented with what you are getting for the price. We made this really clear with copy that described what is special about the model and what comes with the additional price. Visually, by using white vehicles for the base model, and more attractive colours for higher end models, this made it easier to identify the progression upon first glance.
    </br>
      With so many specifications and details that catered to a both detail oriented and high level audiences, we used things like a ‘highlight differences’ feature and sticky nav on scroll. These patterns were useful to avoid overcomplicating the page. Being able to easily expand and collapse categories also helped users to display only what they are interested in, and always having it available.The information for each model was split up into 'Standout features' and 'fine details', aimed at less experienced buyers who just were looking for the main information and then allowing enthusiasts to delve deeper past that into all the specifications. Setting the data up this way allowed for quicker and easier comparisons and led with the key points.
    </br>
    We also decided to limit the amount of vehicles at one time to 3, so as to not overwhelm users, particularly mobile. This meant we only needed to present a 'replace vehicle' option and wouldn't need to worry about people needing to endlessly scroll across, defeating the point of easily comparing. We also would remove the empty state, which was an opportunity to suggest prioritised cars but at the expense of complexity.

      Putting our ideas in front of the users
    </h1>
    <p>
      We had the opportuntiy to conduct some user testing, so I took the designs into Flinto for the first time and created both a desktop and mobile prototype. These had complexities which were hard to build, including the sticky nav on scroll which then had to allow users to scroll horizontally, however despite not being 100% accurate users were able to use the features to help compare the cars. As a result of the UT, we discovered features that were not considered useful such as being able to export the list, or shortlist vehicles. We anticipated people would like these to be included, but stripping them out helped to create heirarchy that focused more on the key CTAs.
