            <p>While at Isobar I was part of the team which created a new direction for the carline pages. With an understanding of our users, the new designs spoke more clearly to their needs,giving them the features, specs & rational material and guide them to create leads and facilitate model selection. </br></br>After we determined  measures of success for the project, my role as a UI designer was to take the page from wireframes to hi fidelity designs, prototype these to take into user testing and work on developing elements and prototypes that would become building blocks for our design system.</p>

        <h4 class="is-size-3 is-size-4-mobile ">Tell a story about each of our vehicles, letting our users find their perfect Holden.</h3>
        <p>We made the decison to always load up 3 vehicles once a user enters the tool, with the vehicles depending where on the site you entered from. This approach would give them a starting point and from there the focus was making it easy to change which vehicles you were comparing, and make sure they are relevant.</br></br>
        Starting with the Equinox and Colorado but rolling out the range of 12 vehicles, we needed a formula that allows each vehicle to remain consistent but display its own unique story. This meant that the components that were created needed to plan for versatility, balancing informative content with room for personality.

        <p>We knew our existing pages lacked clear hierarchy and the information was often hidden behind tabs or expanders, with useful specs being undiscoverable. Having spoken to users, ‘500Nm of torque’ meant nothing, so the new components would need to sell the key pillars of the vehicle in a much clearer way.</br></br>Leading with a hero environment put together by our creative team, our visuals began that story and put key pieces of information front and center, such as price and seats.</br></br>The new ‘narrative components’ continued our theme and was designed for more specific content, avoiding misuse of modules and information. Focusing on only the key features, the points we displayed were now benefit-led and told people how it actually is useful to them.</p>

        <p>For the more decisive and educated car buyers we provided an explore more section. This overlay allowed us to go into more detail with additional imagery and gritty details these users wanted. A clear way to close took the user back to their spot on the page and could continue their journey without interruption.

        <p>This project ran alongside our new design system and these new styles would be used to inform the begininnings of that. Having already workshopped our key goals for that as a team it was an opportunity to bring some initial foundations and components into the concept</br></br>This was a challenge, as we were currently designing within the existing components and were required to try to future proof the system a bit in order to make it relevant for different types of projects. For example, some things we wanted to systemise was the heirarchy of presenting carline names. In the end we refined it to a point where it could be rolled out and updated each of the team members to make sure it was on the right track.</p>
