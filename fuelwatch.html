          Project overview
        </h1>
        <p>
          FuelWatch is a government owned website that allows Western Australians to find the cheapest fuel prices near them. The site hadn't had a
          major update since its inception almost a decade ago - so there was the opportunity to refresh both the visual design and overall experience.

      Objectives
    </h1>
    <p>
      Given it had been some time since it had a meaningful update, a big part of the redesign was introducing standard design patterns into the
      design. A design system was one of the outcomes from the project building upon Isobars boilerplate in Figma allowing clear communication
      during the handover process.
    </br></br>
      With new branding as well, it was a great time to introduce a new colour theme and a more user friendly and playful user interface,
      extending the 'bowser man' from the logo throughout. The previous version was quite corporate and one of my goals was to give it a more
      friendly appearance to balance the heavy data across the website.    </p>

      Constraints
    </h1>
    <p>
      The primary aim of the job was focused around the UI design but early on it was evident there would be some work involved to flesh out the user
      experience as well. Since there were a few gaps in the wireframes and screens or patterns that hadn't been decided on, it was important to run
      ideas past the project team and key stakeholders so we could agree on a clear direction for the website.
      </br></br>
      While I got to work very closely with the project team, the business stakeholders weren't as available so it made it very important to communicate
      the challenges we faced and the proposed solutions when we did have the chance to put work in front of them. As WA has very strict regulations around
      fuel prices and what needs to be shown, there was lots of discussion around the simplest way to include this information on the key screens.

      Process
    </h1>
    <p>
      My first step after setting up my workspace and getting to know the product from consulting the wireframes and technical documentation was to
      begin some initial concepts aiming to find the look and feel for the new branding. The main piece of UX work that was needed to be completed was
      how a user would navigate from the home screen to a more detailed view of a station, as the decision for the home screen to be a map was made before
      my involvement.
      </br></br>
      I set up some of the key components such as the pins, logos, tiles and station detail cards so I could quickly mock up concepts for these flows and
      run them by the team for their input. We all had pretty clear and similar ideas of how the site could be simplified and the preferred option we wanted
      to move forward with. I then gave the rationale behind each idea to the business stakeholders which led to the addition of more complex information so
      it would be in line with regulations.
      </br></br>
      The main challenges of this part of the process was being able to find an elegant solution to inserting this information while maintaining a clean
      interface for users who want to find the information quickly. As there was no user research in scope for the project, or done previously, it was
      really important to consult members of the team who knew the product closely throughout the initial period.

      Additional concepts
    </h1>
    <p>
      I proposed some extra concepts I felt could solve some questions that arose from gaps in the experience which were added to a backlog of future work.
      Being able to favourite or create a save list would allow users to sign up (previously not really promoted on the site) and then setup what they will
      see once they load the site.</p>

      Conclusion
    </h1>
    <p>
      Some of the biggest improvements we made to the new FuelWatch was a much clearer way of displaying the current fuel type selected. By default, ULP
      was always shown and having it prominently within the search box as well as using exposed filters meant it was much easier to see and change what
      you're looking at.
      </br></br>
      Overall, the design aimed to offer a more modern look for the brand and a friendly, clean interface for users who want to very quickly find stations
      nearby them and decide based on price and location, their preferred station, then having the oppurtunity to view additional details and load directions.
