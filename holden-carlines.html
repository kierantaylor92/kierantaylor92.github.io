          Project overview
        </h1>
        <p>
            While at Isobar I was part of the team which created a new direction for the carline pages. With an
            understanding of our users, the new designs spoke more clearly to their needs, giving them the features,
             specs & rational material and guide them to create leads and facilitate model selection. After we determined
             measures of success for the project, my role as a UI designer was to take the page from wireframes to hi
             fidelity designs, prototype these to take into user testing and work on developing elements and prototypes
             that would become building blocks for our design system.

      Tell a story about each of our vehicles, letting our users find their perfect Holden.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Starting with the Equinox and Colorado but rolling out the range of 12 vehicles, we needed a formula
      that allows each vehicle to remain consistent but display its own unique story. This meant that the
      components that were created needed to plan for versatility, balancing informative content with room
      for personality. The project was an opportunity to revisit key components on the site as well as
      introduce new components to build the core of each carline page.</p>

      Building the narratives
    </h1>
    <p>
      We knew our existing pages lacked clear hierarchy and information was often hidden behind tabs or
      expanders. ‘500Nm of torque’ meant nothing, so we would need to sell the key pillars of the vehicle
      in a much clearer way. Leading with a hero environment put together by our creative team, our visuals
      began that story and put key pieces of information front and center. The narrative components beneath
      then told a story of the pillars of each feature, ramping up this part of the experience by using
      animation which I designed to compliment the overall feel of the brand as well as the featured
      content e.g. technology, performance, safety.

      Finding the model for you.
    </h1>
    <p>
      A current pain point for users, the new model selector component was a much clearer way of quickly comparing models within the carline and deciding which spec was best for you. Using our knowledge from the comparison tool project we re-used the idea of building upon the previous mode to show the progression, introduced price and the 3 USPs which would be continued onto the model page, and an entry point to the model comparison for further research.
      </br></br>
      The new model page was where we could go into more detailed specs of each vehicle. The top navigation allowed users to see which car in the range they were viewing and could swap between them while seeing each cars USPs and price, as well as what was on offer. This hero section led into the model configurator which let you customise which colour you're interested in, and seeing offer details if available - or else defaulting to standard warranty features. The vehicle features are displayed beneath your desired model which built on the key USPs and allowed for flexibility of adding extra features within the component for higher end models.

    <p>
      For the more decisive and educated car buyers we provided an explore more section. This overlay allowed us to go into more detail with additional imagery and gritty details these users wanted. A clear way to close took the user back to their spot on the page and could continue their journey without interruption.</p>

      Learnings: Building the design system
    </h1>
    <p>
      This project ran alongside our new design system and these new styles would be used to inform the begininnings of that. Having already workshopped our key goals for that as a team it was an opportunity to bring some initial foundations and components into the concept. This was a challenge, as we were currently designing within the existing components and were required to try to future proof the system a bit in order to make it relevant for different types of projects. For example, some things we wanted to systemise was the heirarchy of presenting carline names. In the end we refined it to a point where it could be rolled out and updated each of the team members to make sure it was on the right track.
